#macro SCRIBBLE_COLOURISE_SPRITES             true   //Whether to apply the text colour to non-animated sprites (animated sprites are always blended white)
#macro SCRIBBLE_VERBOSE                       false  //Enables verbose console output to aid with debugging
#macro SCRIBBLE_ADD_SPRITE_ORIGINS            false  //Whether to use sprite origins. Setting this to <false> will vertically centre sprites on the line of text
#macro SCRIBBLE_SPRITEFONT_ALIGN_GLYPHS_LEFT  false  //Set to <true> to emulate GameMaker's native behaviour
#macro SCRIBBLE_MISSING_CHARACTER             "?"    //Used when a character is missing from a font
#macro SCRIBBLE_FIXED_LINE_HEIGHT             false  //Set to <true> for a little speed boost when caching text! This prevents Scribble from changing line heights to accomodate differently sized fonts/sprites
#macro SCRIBBLE_BGR_COLOR_HEX_CODES           false  //Set to <true> to use GameMaker's #BBGGRR format for in-line hex code colors. <false> uses the industry standard #RRGGBB format
