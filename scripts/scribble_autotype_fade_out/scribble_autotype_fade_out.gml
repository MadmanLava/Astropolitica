/// @param textElement   Text element to target. This element must have been created previously by scribble_draw()
/// @param method        Typewriter method to use to fade out, either per-character or per-line. See below
/// @param speed         Amount of text to reveal per tick (1 tick is usually 1 frame). This is character or lines depending on the method defined above
/// @param smoothness    How much text fades in. Higher numbers will allow more text to be visible as it fades in
/// 
/// The method argument allows you to choose between two behaviours to fade out text. Most retro-styled games will likely want to use
/// SCRIBBLE_AUTOTYPE_PER_CHARACTER: this method will remove characters one by one like a typewriter. Modern text-heavy narrative games
/// may want to use SCRIBBLE_AUTOTYPE_PER_LINE instead.
/// 
/// How the text is revealed can be customised further by modifying the smoothness argument. A high value will cause text to be smoothly
/// faded out whereas a smoothness of 0 will cause text to instantly pop onto the screen. For advanced users, custom shader code can be
/// easily combined with the smoothness value to animate text as it fades out.
/// 
/// Events will not be executed as text fades out.
